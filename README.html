<h1>yabasic_2.78.5</h1>

<p>This depository contains the framework for creating a bare-bones .DEB file for the yabasic programming language.</p>

<p>The DEB you can download here requires an x86_64 linux to run on. but you can always clone the git repository and run the shell script to make your own 32-bit version.</p>

<p>There was a DEB version on the www.yabasic.de website last time I looked, but the dependencies were a little old-fashioned and it segfaulted immediately. So I decided to make my own. By all means try both.</p>

<p>All versions will be stored in the <em>build</em> folder.</p>
